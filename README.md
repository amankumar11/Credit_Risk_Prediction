# ðŸ’³ Credit Risk Analyzer  
**Predict Loan Default Risk using Machine Learning**

This project is a **Streamlit web application** that predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to **default** on their loan or not, based on financial and demographic information.  
It uses a trained **Random Forest Classifier** model on a Kaggle dataset: *Loan Default Prediction Dataset*.  

---

## Features

- Predicts **loan default risk** from user inputs  
- Handles **categorical encoding and scaling** automatically  
- Displays prediction confidence and risk category  
- Includes a **trained model** (`credit_analyzer_model.pkl`)  
- Built with **Streamlit**, **scikit-learn**, and **pandas**
